## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

-   Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
    e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

-   Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
    e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

-   Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
    e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

-   Parameters can be in any order.<br>
    e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

-   If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
    e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

-   Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
    e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## Dashboard
The dashboard is the default landing page of the app and displays a summary of relevant information from the other sections of the app.
* The dashboard by default shows:
  * A list of the user’s todos which are not completed (earliest added, up to 5)
  * The user’s schedule for the day, or the next 5 entries in the schedule
* In future versions, the user will be able to customise what they wish to see on the dashboard.

This is a mockup of how the dashboard will look like (to be updated in v1.2):

## General

### Switching between Tabs: `tab`

Format: `tab /TAB NAME`

    * dashboard
    * contacts
    * schedule
    * todos

* `tab contacts` in the Contacts tab just jumps to the top of the page (returns the tab to the original landing page view)

### Convenience Commands

Allows users to input commands meant for a specific tab regardless of which tab they are currently viewing.

Format: [commands listed by other functionalities]

Examples:
* When in Todos tab, input `/schedule add event des/CS2103 meeting from/1300 to/1500` will add an event in Schedule tab instead of adding it in Todos tab.
* When in Dashboard tab, input `/schedule delete 2` will remove the event at index `2` under the Schedule tab.
* When in Schedule tab, input `/schedule delete 2` and `delete 2` produces the same effect, removing the event at index `2` under the Schedule tab.

### Exiting Application: `exit`

Terminates the application

Format: `exit`

Example:
* exit in any tabs terminates the application.

### Handling invalid commands

Handles error messages thrown by tabs (in the case of invalid commands passed to said pages control), and displays a user friendly message.

Examples:
* `/schedule create` will print the error message as such:
```
“Looks like ‘Schedule’ does not have any commands called ‘create’. Below are the available commands:
<!--error message that schedule returns-->
```
